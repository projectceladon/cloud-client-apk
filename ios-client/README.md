# IntelÂ® Collaboration Suite for WebRTC iOS Samples README 2021

### Dependencies

- Create a folder name it as ```Framework```, put ```libsioclient.a``` and ```OWT.framework``` and ```WebRTC.framework``` in it. For OWT and WEBRTC framework you can build them from [owt-client-native](https://github.com/open-webrtc-toolkit/owt-client-native)
- Delete empty folder ```Resources``` from ```OWT.framework``` or it may report error when installing app to real device.
- Use ```OWTP2P.xcworkspace``` to open project.

### TLS/SSL

- Basic example server also accepts HTTPS requests, so you can modify sample code to fetch token with HTTPS requests.
- The ```sioclient_tls.a``` provided in release package will verify server's certificate, so do remember to replace conference server's certificate(```<conference server folder>/cert/certificate.pfx```) with a trusted one. Or you can disable ssl by changing ```config.erizoController.ssl```(in ```<conference server folder>/etc/woogeen_config.js```) to ```false``` and replace ```sioclient_tls.a``` with ```sioclient.a```.
- As ATS(Application Transport Security) is required by the end of 2016, please enable TLS/SSL in production environments, and remove "NSAllowsArbitraryLoads" from samples' info.plist before submitting for App Store review.
